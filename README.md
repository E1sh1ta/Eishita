<h2 align="left">👋 Hey there! I'm Eishita</h2>

<p align="left">
I'm a <strong>Computer Science graduate</strong> from <em>International Islamic University Chittagong </em> with a deep interest in designing scalable data systems and building efficient data pipelines. My journey in tech started with writing basic C programs, and now I'm diving into the world of <strong>Data Engineering</strong> — working with real-world datasets, transforming data for insights, and automating workflows.
</p>

<p align="left">
Right now, I'm focused on:
<ul>
  <li>🔧 Developing ETL pipelines using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Pandas</strong></li>
  <li>🗄️ Querying and managing relational databases with <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>MySQL/PostgreSQL</strong></li>
  <li>☁️ Exploring cloud tools like <strong>Google BigQuery</strong> and <strong>AWS S3</strong></li>
  <li>📊 Learning orchestration with <strong>Apache Airflow</strong> and handling batch data</li>
</ul>
</p>

This GitHub repository is part of my active learning process — where I document mini projects, experiments, and exercises that help me grow as a future Data Engineer. I believe in learning by doing and constantly improving through iteration and feedback.
